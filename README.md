# Pulse - Sentiment Analysis using Chat GPT
This project uses the Chat GPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, to perform sentiment analysis on text data generated from customer reviews. The project  includes a Jupyter notebook containing the code used for calling the OpenAI prompts on the review data, a Power BI dashboard for visualizing the sentiment analysis results, and the review data.


## Jupyter Notebook
The pulse.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains the code used for training and testing the Chat GPT model. The notebook first loads the data, preprocesses it, and then trains the model using transfer learning on the Chat GPT architecture. The trained model is then used to predict the sentiment of new text data.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Hackathon Dashboard updated.pbix Power BI dashboard provides a visual representation of the sentiment analysis results. The dashboard displays a breakdown of the sentiment categories (positive, negative, and neutral) and also provides insights into the most common words associated with each sentiment category.

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the pulse.ipynb Jupyter notebook to run the code. You can also open the Hackathon Dashboard updated.pbix Power BI dashboard to view the sentiment analysis results.
