# Pulse - Customer Experience Hub (CXHub)
The Customer Experience Hub (CXHub) is an innovative project that leverages the power of Generative AI to capture, analyze, and visualize customer feedback from various channels. It is designed to provide businesses with actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. The project  includes a Jupyter notebook containing the code used for calling the OpenAI prompts on the review data, a Power BI dashboard for visualizing the sentiment analysis results, and the review data.

##Overview
CXHub is a platform that gathers customer feedback from multiple sources such as social media, support tickets, chatbots, and surveys, then uses Generative AI to analyze and categorize the data. This helps businesses identify trends, monitor customer sentiment, and address issues effectively.

By incorporating Generative AI, CXHub can generate summaries of customer feedback, identify the most critical points, and automatically respond to common queries, ensuring a streamlined and efficient customer service process.

##Features
Multi-channel data collection: CXHub collects customer feedback from various channels including social media platforms, support tickets, chatbots, and surveys.
Generative AI analysis: The platform utilizes advanced Generative AI models to analyze customer feedback and generate insights.
Sentiment analysis: CXHub performs sentiment analysis on customer feedback to gauge customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
Dashboard & reporting: A comprehensive dashboard provides a visual representation of customer feedback data, enabling users to monitor trends and sentiment over time.
Customizable: CXHub can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a business or industry.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Pulse.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains the code used for training and testing the Chat GPT model. The notebook first loads the data, preprocesses it, and then trains the model using transfer learning on the Chat GPT architecture. The trained model is then used to predict the sentiment of new text data.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Hackathon Dashboard updated.pbix Power BI dashboard provides a visual representation of the sentiment analysis results. The dashboard displays a breakdown of the sentiment categories (positive, negative, and neutral) and also provides insights into the most common words associated with each sentiment category.

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the Pulse.ipynb Jupyter notebook to run the code. You can also open the Hackathon Dashboard updated.pbix Power BI dashboard to view the sentiment analysis results.
